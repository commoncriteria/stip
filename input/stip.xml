    <sec:Overview>
      The scope of this PP-Module is to describe the security functionality of a virtual private network (VPN)
      client in terms of  <xref g="CC"/> and to define functional and assurance requirements for such
      products. This PP-Module is intended for use with the following Base-PPs:

      <h:ul>
        <h:li>Protection Profile for General Purpose Operating Systems (OS PP), Version 4.2.1</h:li>
        <h:li>Protection Profile for Mobile Device Fundamentals (MDF PP), Version 3.2</h:li>
        <h:li>Protection Profile for Application Software (App PP), Version 1.3</h:li>
        <h:li>Protection Profile for Mobile Device Management (MDM PP), Version 4.0</h:li>
      </h:ul>

      These Base-PPs are all valid because a VPN client may be a specific type of stand-alone software
      application or a built-in component of an operating system, whether desktop or mobile. Regardless of
      which Base-PP is claimed, the VPN client functionality defined by this PP-Module will rely on the Base-PP.
      Sections 5.1, 5.2, and 5.3 of this PP-Module describe the relevant functionality for each Base-PP,
      including specific selections, assignments, or inclusion of optional requirements that must be made as
      needed to support the VPN client functionality.

    <!-- 1.3 Compliant Targets of Evaluation -->
    <sec:Compliant_Targets_of_Evaluation>
      The TOE defined by this PP-Module is the VPN client, a software application that runs on a physical or
      virtual host platform, used to establish a secure IPsec connection between that host platform and a
      remote system. The VPN client is intended to be located outside or inside of a private network, and
      establishes a secure tunnel to an IPsec peer. For the purposes of this PP-Module, IPsec peers are defined
      as:

      <h:ul>
        <h:li>VPN gateways</h:li>
        <h:li>Other VPN clients</h:li>
        <h:li>An IPsec-capable network device (supporting IPsec for the purposes of management)</h:li>
      </h:ul>

      The tunnel provides confidentiality, integrity, and data authentication for information that travels across
      a less trusted (sometimes public) network. All VPN clients that comply with this document will support
      IPsec.<h:p/>

      This PP-Module extends the GPOS PP when the VPN client is installed on an operating system discussed
      in that PP (e.g., Windows, Mac OS, Linux). This PP-Module extends the MDF PP when the VPN client is
      installed on a self-contained mobile device that is bundled with an operating system (e.g. Android,
      BlackBerry OS, iOS, Windows Mobile). This PP-Module extends the App PP when the VPN client is
      provided by a third party and is a standalone application that is not a bundled part of an operating
      system or mobile device. This PP-Module extends the MDM PP when the VPN Client is included with
      MDM Server software that is used for centralized deployment and administration of enterprise mobile
      device policies.  <h:p/>

      As a PP-Module of any of these PPs, it is expected that the content of this PP-Module and the chosen
      Base-PP be appropriately combined in the context of each product-specific Security Target. This PPModule has been specifically defined such that there should be no difficulty or ambiguity in doing so.
      When this PP-Module is used, conformant TOEs are obligated to implement the functionality required in
      the claimed Base-PP with the additional functionality defined in this PP-Module in response to the
      threat environment discussed subsequently herein.

      <!-- 1.3.1 TOE Boundary -->
      <sec:TOE_Boundary>
      The TOE defined by this PP-Module is purely a software solution executing on a platform (some sort of
      operating system running on hardware). Depending on the Base-PP claimed as part of the TOE, the
      platform may also be part of the TOE or it may be an environmental component that the TOE vendor has
      no control over. Regardless of whether the platform itself is within the scope of the evaluation, the VPN
      client itself will rely on the platform for its execution domain and proper usage. The vendor is expected
      to provide sufficient installation and configuration instructions to identify an Operational Environment
      with the necessary features and to provide instructions for how to configure it correctly.<h:p/>

      The PP-Module contains requirements that must be met by the TOE. Depending on the Base-PP that is
      claimed, there may be some variation in the applicable requirements. This is because a given Base-PP
      may include one or more requirements that the VPN client can inherit but are not shared amongst each
      possible Base-PP.<h:p/>

      This is somewhat different than other PPs, but addresses most implementations of VPN clients where
      some part of the functionality of the IPsec tunnel is provided by the platform. In terms of the
      cryptographic primitives (random bit generation, encryption/decryption, key generation, etc.) it is
      actually desirable that a well-tested implementation in the platform is used rather than trying to
      implement these functions in each client.<h:p/>

      Requirements that can be satisfied by either the TOE or the platform are identified in Section 5 by text
      such as “The [selection: TSF, TOE platform] shall…” The ST author will make the appropriate selection
      based on where that element is implemented. It is allowable for some elements in a component to be 
      implemented by the TOE, while other elements in that same component be implemented by the
      platform (requirements on the usage of X.509 certificates is an example of where this might be the case,
      where using the information contained in the certificates and the implementation of revocation
      checking may be done by the TOE, but storage and protection of the certificates may be done by the
      platform). Note that in the cases where this PP-Module is used to extend the GPOS PP or MDF PP, the
      TOE includes both the VPN client and the platform. In this case, it is appropriate to indicate that the TOE
      satisfies this requirement. However, the ST author should make it clear, for each of these components,
      which are implemented by the VPN client portion of the TOE versus the platform portion.<h:p/>

      A Supporting Document (SD) accompanies this PP-Module and contains guidance for how to evaluate
      the requirements defined by the PP-Module, expressed as Evaluation Activities (EAs). EAs will differ
      based on where the function that meets the requirement is implemented. In most cases, requirements
      implemented by the platform will require that the evaluator examine documents pertaining to the
      platform (generally the ST), while requirements implemented by the TOE may require examination of
      the TSS, examination of the Operational Guidance, and/or execution of evaluator testing. For
      requirements implemented by the platform there may also be requirements that the evaluators
      examine the interfaces used by the TOE to access these functions on the platform to ensure that the
      functionality being invoked to satisfy the requirements of this PP-Module is the same functionality that
      was evaluated.<h:p/>

      Given the degree of coupling between a VPN client and its underlying platform, it is expected that the
      client will be tested on each platform claimed in the ST. In cases where the platforms are simply
      different versions of the same operating system (provided by the same platform vendor), an equivalency
      argument may be made in lieu of testing on each version. The argument would have to demonstrate
      that the client interacts in exactly the same way with the versions of the OS - e.g., same APIs are used
      with the same parameters, the network stack is modified with exactly the same kernel modules. The
      evaluator uses the operational guidance to configure the TOE and underlying platform.<h:p/>

      A TOE that conforms to this PP-Module will implement the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF)
      Internet Protocol Security (IPsec) Security Architecture for the Internet Protocol, RFC 4301, as well as
      the IPsec Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP) protocol. IPsec ESP is specified in RFC 2406 and RFC 4303.
      The IPsec VPN client will support ESP in either tunnel mode, transport mode, or both modes.  <h:p/>

      The IPsec VPN client will use the Internet Key Exchange (IKE)v1 protocol, IKEv2, or both. IKEv1 is
      implemented as defined in RFCs 2407, 2408, 2409, 4109, and IKEv2 is implemented as specified in RFC
      7296 (with mandatory support for NAT traversal as specified in section 2.23) and 4307 to authenticate
      and establish session keys with the VPN entities. <h:p/>

      In order to show that the TSF implements the RFCs correctly, the evaluator will perform EAs
      documented in the Supporting Document that accompanies this PP-Module. In future versions of this
      PP-Module, EAs may be augmented, or new ones introduced that cover more aspects of RFC compliance
      than is currently described in this publication.<h:p/>

      The IPsec VPN client enables encryption of all information that flows between itself and its IPsec peer.
      The VPN client serves as an endpoint for an IPsec VPN connection and performs a number of
      cryptographic functions related to establishing and maintaining that connection. If the cryptography
      used to perform endpoint authentication, generate keys, and encrypt information is sufficiently robust
      and the implementation has no critical design mistakes, an adversary will be unable to exhaust the
      encryption key space to obtain the data. Compliance with IPsec standards, use of a properly seeded
      Random Bit Generator (RBG), and secure authentication factors will ensure that access to the 
      transmitted information cannot be obtained with less work than a full exhaust of the key space. Any
      plaintext secret and private keys or other cryptographic security parameters will be zeroized when no
      longer in use to prevent disclosure of security critical data.
      </sec:TOE_Boundary>
    </sec:Compliant_Targets_of_Evaluation>
    
    <!-- 1.4 Use Cases -->
    <sec:Use_Cases>
      A VPN client allows users on the TOE platform to establish secure IPsec communications, providing
      confidentiality, integrity, and protection of data, across a less trusted network in order to secure data in
      transit. This PP-Module defines three use cases for VPN clients. A conformant TOE will implement one or
      more of the use cases specified below:<h:p/>
      
      <usecases>
        <usecase id="usecase1" title="TOE to VPN Gateway">
          <description>A VPN client allows users on the TOE platform to establish an encrypted IPsec tunnel across a
            less trusted, often unprotected public, network to a private network (see <xref to="fig-usecase1"/>). In this case,
            the TOE provides encryption/decryption of network packets as they leave/arrive the VPN client’s
            underlying platform. IP packets crossing from the private network to the public network will be
            encrypted if their destination is a remote access VPN client supporting the same VPN policy as
            the source network. <h:p/>
            The TOE is responsible for encrypting the packets that are intended to be received by the target
            on the private network and then encapsulating these packets in a way that allows the VPN
            gateway to securely receive them and forward them to their final destination.
            <figure entity="images/usecase1.png" title="TOE to VPN Gateway" id="fig-usecase1"/>
			</description>
        </usecase>

          <usecase id="usecase2" title="TOE to VPN Client">
            <description>A VPN client may additionally or alternatively allow a client computer to connect directly to
              another computer running a VPN client (see <xref to="fig-usecase2"/>). In this case, the functionality of the VPN
              client is to connect directly to another endpoint system in order to facilitate communications
              directly to that system.<h:p/>
              IPsec transport mode is used for end-to-end communications. In this use case, the content of
              the packet data (payload) is encrypted but the original IP header is preserved. Inherent to this
              use case, when two peers are communicating directly, is the disclosure of the
              source/destination of the packets. Users should take into consideration any security risks
              associated with this disclosure when architecting their networks in line with this use case.
              <figure entity="images/usecase2.png" title="TOE to VPN Client" id="fig-usecase2"/>
            </description>
          </usecase>

        <usecase id="usecase3" title="TOE to IPsec-capable Network Device">
          <description>Similar to Use Case 2 above, a VPN client TOE can also be used to establish a secure connection
            to an IPsec-capable network device using IPsec, similar to how SSH can be used. In this case,
            where a network device is being managed remotely over an IPsec connection, the network
            device itself must contain IPsec functionality to act as the peer for the connection (see <xref to="fig-usecase3"/>).
            <h:p/>
            While this will behave functionally the same way as the scenario described by Use Case 2, the
            user of the TOE in Use Case 3 is a network administrator who is assumed to have administrative
            access to the network device they are connecting to.

  <!-- Security Problem Description -->
  <sec:Security_Problem_Description>
    The security problem is described in terms of the threats that the TOE is expected to address,
assumptions about its operational environment, and any organizational security policies that the TOE is
expected to enforce.<h:p/>
    This PP-Module is written to address the situation in which a user accesses a private network (e.g. the
    user’s office network) or terminal endpoint (e.g. a network device) using a less trusted network (such as
    a public Wi-Fi network or local area network). Protection of network packets is desired as they traverse
    a public network. To protect the data in-transit from disclosure and modification, a VPN is created to
    establish secure communications. The VPN client provides one end of the secure VPN tunnel and
    performs encryption and decryption of network packets in accordance with a VPN security policy
    negotiated between the VPN client (TOE) and its IPsec peer.<h:p/>
    The proper installation and configuration of the VPN client is critical to its correct operation such that
    proper handling of the TOE by an administrator is also addressed.<h:p/>
    Note that as a PP-Module, all threats, assumptions, and OSPs defined in the Base-PP will also apply to a
    TOE unless otherwise specified, depending on which of the Base-PPs it extends. The Security Functional
    Requirements defined in this PP-Module will mitigate the threats that are defined in the PP-Module but
    may also mitigate some threats defined in the Base-PPs in more comprehensive detail due to the
    specific capabilities provided by a VPN client.
    
    <!-- 3.1 Threats -->
    <section title="Threats" id="threats">
      The following threats defined in this PP-Module extend the threats defined by the Base-PPs.
      <threats>
        <threat name="T.UNAUTHORIZED_ACCESS">
          <description>This PP-Module does not include requirements that can protect against an insider threat. Authorized
            users are not considered hostile or malicious and are trusted to follow appropriate guidance. Only
            authorized personnel should have access to the system or device that contains the IPsec VPN client.
            Therefore, the primary threat agents are the unauthorized entities that try to gain access to the
            protected network (in cases where tunnel mode is used) or to plaintext data that traverses the
            public network (regardless of whether transport mode or tunnel mode is used). <h:p/>
            The endpoint of the network communication can be both geographically and logically distant from
            the TOE, and can pass through a variety of other systems. These intermediate systems may be under
            the control of the adversary, and offer an opportunity for communications over the network to be
            compromised. <h:p/>
            Plaintext communication over the network may allow critical data (such as passwords, configuration
            settings, and user data) to be read and/or manipulated directly by intermediate systems, leading to
            a compromise of the TOE or to the secured environmental system(s) that the TOE is being used to
            facilitate communications with. IPsec can be used to provide protection for this communication;
            however, there are myriad options that can be implemented for the protocol to be compliant to the
            protocol specification listed in the RFC. Some of these options can have negative impacts on the
            security of the connection. For instance, using a weak encryption algorithm (even one that is
            allowed by the RFC, such as DES) can allow an adversary to read and even manipulate the data on
            the encrypted channel, thus circumventing countermeasures in place to prevent such attacks.
            Further, if the protocol is implemented with little-used or non-standard options, it may be compliant 
            with the protocol specification but will not be able to interact with other, diverse equipment that is
            typically found in large enterprises. <h:p/>
            Even though the communication path is protected, there is a possibility that the IPsec peer could be
            duped into thinking that a malicious third-party user or system is the TOE. For instance, a
            middleman could intercept a connection request to the TOE, and respond to the request as if it were
            the TOE. In a similar manner, the TOE could also be duped into thinking that it is establishing
            communications with a legitimate IPsec peer when in fact it is not. An attacker could also mount a
            malicious man-in-the-middle-type of attack, in which an intermediate system is compromised, and
            the traffic is proxied, examined, and modified by this system. This attack can even be mounted via
            encrypted communication channels if appropriate countermeasures are not applied. These attacks
            are, in part, enabled by a malicious attacker capturing network traffic (for instance, an
            authentication session) and “playing back” that traffic in order to fool an endpoint into thinking it
            was communicating with a legitimate remote entity.</description>

    The Security Functional Requirements (SFRs) included in this section are derived from Part 2 of the
    Common Criteria for Information Technology Security Evaluation, Version 3.1, Revision 5, with
    additional extended functional components.<h:p/>
    The CC defines operations on Security Functional Requirements: assignments, selections, assignments
    within selections and refinements. This document uses the following font conventions to identify the
    operations defined by the CC:<h:p/>
    <h:ul>
      <h:li>Assignments are indicated with <h:i>italicized</h:i> text.</h:li>
      <h:li>Refinements made by the PP-Module author are indicated with <h:b>bold text</h:b> for added or substituted
        text and <h:s>strikethrough</h:s> text for removed text. Refinements are only applied to significant technical
        changes to existing SFRs; minor presentation changes with no technical impact (such as British vs
        American spelling differences) are not marked as refinements. Refinements are also indicated when
        an operation is added or substituted for an existing operation (e.g. the PP-Module completes an
        assignment in such a way that it introduces a selection into the assignment).<h:p/>
        Note that for SFRs that are defined either in CC Part 2 or in this PP-Module’s Extended Components
        Definition, the refinement operation is used to indicate deviations from the defined component. For
        Base-PP SFRs that are modified by this PP-Module, the refinement operation is used to indicate
        deviations from the Base-PP’s definition of the SFR (i.e. if the Base-PP refined an SFR and that
        change is not affected by this PP-Module, it is not shown here as a refinement).</h:li>
      <h:li>Selections are indicated with <h:i>italicized</h:i> text.</h:li>

      <con-mod ref="fau-gen-1-vpn">Audit records generated by the VPN client do not interfere with GPOS

		    <!-- Moved here from top of SFR for schema compliance -->
			In the following elements of the FCS_IPSEC_EXT.1 component, it is allowable for some or all of the
			individual elements to be implemented by the platform on which the VPN client operates. However, this
			is only the case when the platform is within the TOE boundary, as is the case where this PP-Module is
			being claimed on top of a general-purpose operating system or a mobile device.<h:p/>
			When the TOE is a standalone software application, the IPsec functionality must be implemented by the
			TSF, though it is permissible for the TSF to invoke cryptographic algorithm services from the TOE
			platform to support the TOE’s implementation of IPsec. The TOE may also rely on the TOE platform for
			X.509 certificate validation services, though it is the responsibility of the TSF to take the proper action
			based on the validation response that is returned.<h:p/>
			It is also permissible for the TSF to rely on low-level capabilities of the platform to perform enforcement
			and routing functions as a result of the policies the TSF maintains. For example, while the TSF must
			provide the capability to implement the Security Policy Database abstraction, it is allowed for the TSF to
			depend on the platform-provided network stack/driver to perform the low-level packet filtering and
			routing actions once the TSF has set up those rules as defined by the SPD.<h:p/>
			While enforcement of the IPsec requirements must be implemented by the TSF, it is permissible for the
			TSF to receive configuration of the IPsec behavior from an environmental source, most notably a VPN
			gateway. <h:p/>

		    	<!-- Original element 1 AppNote -->
				RFC 4301 calls for an IPsec implementation to protect IP traffic through the use
				of a Security Policy Database (SPD). The SPD is used to define how IP packets are
				to be handled: PROTECT the packet (e.g., encrypt the packet), BYPASS the IPsec
				services (e.g., no encryption), or DISCARD the packet (e.g., drop the packet). The
				SPD can be implemented in various ways, including router access control lists,
				firewall rulesets, a "traditional" SPD, etc. Regardless of the implementation
				details, there is a notion of a "rule" that a packet is "matched" against and a
				resulting action that takes place.<h:p/>
				While there must be a means to order the rules, a general approach to ordering
				is not mandated, as long as the TOE can distinguish the IP packets and apply the
				rules accordingly. There may be multiple SPDs (one for each network interface),
				but this is not required.<h:p/>

			Note in this case that the implementation of the IPsec protocol must be enforced entirely within the TOE
			boundary; i.e. it is not permissible for a software application TOE to be a graphical front-end for IPsec
			functionality implemented totally or in part by the underlying OS platform. The behavior referenced here
			is for the possibility that the configuration of the IPsec connection is initiated from outside the TOE, which
			is permissible so long as the TSF is solely responsible for enforcing the configured behavior. However, it is

			from the client (e.g., enforcement of packet routing decisions).<h:p/>

			As a prerequisite for performing the Test EAs for the individual FCS_IPSEC_EXT.1 elements below, the

			The evaluator shall minimally create a test environment equivalent to the test environment illustrated
			below. It is expected that the traffic generator is used to construct network packets and will provide the

            <aactivity level="element"> 
              <TSS>The evaluator shall examine the TSS and determine that it describes how the IPsec capabilities are
				implemented.<h:p/>

                If the TOE is a standalone software application, the evaluator shall ensure that the TSS asserts that all
				IPsec functionality is implemented by the TSF. The evaluator shall also ensure that the TSS identifies what
				platform functionality the TSF relies upon to support its IPsec implementation, if any (e.g. does it invoke
				cryptographic primitive functions from the platform’s cryptographic library, enforcement of packet
				routing decisions by low-level network drivers).<h:p/>

                If the TOE is part of a general-purpose desktop or mobile operating system, the evaluator shall ensure
				that the TSS describes at a high level the architectural relationship between the VPN client portion of the
				TOE and the rest of the TOE (e.g. is the VPN client an integrated part of the OS or is it a standalone
				executable that is bundled into the OS package). If the SPD is implemented by the underlying platform in
				this case, then the TSS describes how the client interacts with the platform to establish and populate the
				SPD, including the identification of the platform's interfaces that are used by the client.<h:p/>
		    
				In all cases, the evaluator shall also ensure that the TSS describes how the client interacts with the network
				stack of the platform(s) on which it can run (e.g., does the client insert itself within the stack via kernel
				mods, does the client simply invoke APIs to gain access to network services).<h:p/>
		      
				The evaluator shall ensure that the TSS describes how the SPD is implemented and the rules for processing
				both inbound and outbound packets in terms of the IPsec policy. The TSS describes the rules that are
				available and the resulting actions available after matching a rule. The TSS describes how the available
				rules and actions form the SPD using terms defined in RFC 4301 such as BYPASS (e.g., no encryption),
				DISCARD (e.g., drop the packet), and PROTECT (e.g., encrypt the packet) actions defined in RFC 4301.
			  
				As noted in section 4.4.1 of RFC 4301, the processing of entries in the SPD is non-trivial and the evaluator
				shall determine that the description in the TSS is sufficient to determine which rules will be applied given
				the rule structure implemented by the TOE. For example, if the TOE allows specification of ranges,
				conditional rules, etc., the evaluator shall determine that the description of rule processing (for both
				inbound and outbound packets) is sufficient to determine the action that will be applied, especially in the
				case where two different rules may apply. This description shall cover both the initial packets (that is, no
				SA is established on the interface or for that particular packet) as well as packets that are part of an
				established SA. <h:p/>
			</TSS>    
              <Guidance>
                The evaluator shall examine the operational guidance to verify it describes how the SPD is created and
		configured. If there is an administrative interface to the client, then the guidance describes how the
		administrator specifies rules for processing a packet. The description includes all three cases - a rule that
		ensures packets are encrypted/decrypted, dropped, and allowing a packet to flow in plaintext. The
		evaluator shall determine that the description in the operational guidance is consistent with the
		description in the TSS, and that the level of detail in the operational guidance is sufficient to allow the
		administrator to set up the SPD in an unambiguous fashion. This includes a discussion of how ordering of
		rules impacts the processing of an IP packet.<h:p/>

                If the client is configured by an external application, such as the VPN gateway, then the operational
		guidance should indicate this and provide a description of how the client is configured by the external
		application. The description should contain information as to how the SPD is established and set up in an
		unambiguous fashion. The description should also include what is configurable via the external
		application, how ordering of entries may be expressed, as well as the impacts that ordering of entries may
		have on the packet processing.<h:p/>

               	In either case, the evaluator ensures the description provided In the TSS is consistent with the capabilities
		and description provided in the operational guidance.<h:p/>
              </Guidance>
              <Tests>
                Depending on the implementation, the evaluator may be required to use a VPN gateway or some form of
		application to configure the client. For Test 2, the evaluator is required to choose an application that
		allows for the configuration of the full set of capabilities of the VPN client (in conjunction with the
		platform). For example, if the client provides a robust interface that allows for specification of wildcards,
		subnets, etc., it is unacceptable for the evaluator to choose a VPN Gateway that only allows for specifying
		a single fully qualified IP addresses in the rule.<h:p/>

                The evaluator shall perform the following tests:
                <testlist>
                  <test>: The evaluator shall configure an SPD on the client that is capable of the following: dropping a
			packet, encrypting a packet, and allowing a packet to flow in plaintext. The selectors used in the
			construction of the rule shall be different such that the evaluator can generate a packet and send packets
			to the client with the appropriate fields (fields that are used by the rule - e.g., the IP addresses, TCP/UDP
			ports) in the packet header. The evaluator performs both positive and negative test cases for each type
			of rule. The evaluator observes via the audit trail, and packet captures that the TOE exhibited the expected
			behavior: appropriate packets were dropped, allowed through without modification, was encrypted by
			the IPsec implementation.</test>
                  <test>The evaluator shall devise several tests that cover a variety of scenarios for packet processing.
			These scenarios must exercise the range of possibilities for SPD entries and processing modes as outlined
			in the TSS and operational guidance. Potential areas to cover include rules with overlapping ranges and
			conflicting entries, inbound and outbound packets, and packets that establish SAs as well as packets that
			belong to established SAs. The evaluator shall verify, via the audit trail and packet captures, for each
			scenario that the expected behavior is exhibited, and is consistent with both the TSS and the operational
			guidance.

		rekeying the SA when necessary. If the two ends have different lifetime policies, the end with the shorter
		lifetime will end up always being the one to request the rekeying. If the two ends have the same lifetime
		policies, it is possible that both will initiate a rekeying at the same time (which will result in redundant
		SAs). To reduce the probability of this happening, the timing of rekeying requests SHOULD be jittered.”<h:p/>

		packet, and that if that buffer is re-used, those data might remain and make their way into a new packet.
		The evaluator shall check to ensure that the TSS describes packet processing to the extent that they can
		determine that no data will be reused when processing network packets. The evaluator shall ensure that
		this description at a minimum describes how the previous data are zeroized/overwritten, and at what

			This PP-Module does not define any SARs beyond those defined within the Base-PPs to which it can

			inherently evaluated against the GPOS PP, MDF PP, App PP, or MDM PP as well. These PPs include a
			number of EAs associated with both Security Functional Requirements (SFRs) and SARs. Additionally, this
			PP-Module includes a number of SFR-based EAs that similarly refine the SARs of the Base-PPs. The

			with the necessary SFRs that are taken from this PP-Module.

		Adoption by vendors is encouraged and expected as soon as possible.
		The third type (in A.3) are implementation-dependent requirements that are dependent on the TOE

			The TOE may support pre-shared keys for use in the IPsec protocol, and may use pre-shared keys in
			other protocols as well. There are two types of pre-shared keys that must be supported by the TOE, as
			specified in the requirements below. The first type is referred to as “text-based pre-shared keys,” which
			refer to pre-shared keys that are entered by users as a string of characters from a standard character
			set, similar to a password. Such pre-shared keys must be conditioned so that the string of characters is
			transformed into a string of bits, which is then used as the key.<h:p/>
			The second type is referred to as “bit-based pre-shared keys” (for lack of a standard term); this refers to
			keys that are either generated by the TSF on a command from the administrator, or input in "direct
			form" by an administrator. "Direct form" means that the input is used directly as the key, with no
			"conditioning" as was the case for text-based pre-shared keys. An example would be a string of hex
			digits that represent the bits that comprise the key.<h:p/>
			The requirements below mandate that the TOE support text-based pre-shared keys. Bit-based preshared keys 
	      		may or may not be supported, and if they are, generation of these keys may be done either

				In the case of "a", the audit functions referred to are those provided by the TOE.
				For example, in the case that the TOE was a stand-alone executable, auditing
				the startup and the shutdown of the TOE itself would be sufficient to meet the
				requirements of this clause. <h:p/>
				Many auditable aspects of the SFRs included in this document deal with
				administrative actions. Item c above requires all administrative actions to be
				auditable, so no additional specification of the auditability of these actions is
				present in the Auditable Events table. While the TOE itself does not need to
				provide the ability to perform I&amp;A for an administrator, this requirement implies
				that the TOE possess the capability to audit the events described by the Base-PP
				as "administrative actions" (primarily dealing with configuration of the
				functionality provided by the TOE). <h:p/>
				The auditable events defined in the Auditable Events table are for the SFRs that

				the TOE based on the claimed Base-PP, it is expected that any applicable
				auditable events defined for those SFRs in the Base-PP are also claimed as part
				of the TSF. These auditable events only apply if the client actually performs these
				functions. If the platform performs any of these actions, then the platform is
				responsible for performing the auditing, not the TSF<h:p/>

              <Guidance>The evaluator shall check the operational guidance and ensure that it lists all of the auditable events and
			provides a format for audit records. Each audit record format type must be covered, along with a brief
			description of each field. The evaluator shall check to make sure that every audit event type mandated by
			the VPN Client PP-Module is described and that the description of the fields contains the information
			required in FAU_GEN.1.2/VPN, and the additional information specified in the Auditable Events table of
			the VPN Client PP-PP-Module.
			<h:p/>

               In particular, the evaluator shall ensure that the operational guidance is clear in relation to the contents
		for failed cryptographic events. In the Auditable Events table of the VPN Client PP-Module, information
		detailing the cryptographic mode of operation and a name or identifier for the object being encrypted is
		required. The evaluator shall ensure that name or identifier is sufficient to allow an administrator
		reviewing the audit log to determine the context of the cryptographic operation (for example, performed
		during a key negotiation exchange, performed when encrypting data for transit) as well as the non-TOE
		endpoint of the connection for cryptographic failures relating to communications with other IT systems.<h:p/>

               The evaluator shall also make a determination of the administrative actions that are relevant in the
		context of the VPN Client PP-Module. The TOE may contain functionality that is not evaluated in the
		context of the VPN Client PP-Module because the functionality is not specified in an SFR. This functionality
		may have administrative aspects that are described in the operational guidance. Since such administrative
		actions will not be performed in an evaluated configuration of the TOE, the evaluator shall examine the
		operational guidance and make a determination of which administrative commands, including
		subcommands, scripts, and configuration files, are related to the configuration (including enabling or
		disabling) of the mechanisms implemented in the TOE that are necessary to enforce the requirements
		specified in the VPN Client PP-Module, which thus form the set of “all administrative actions”. The
		evaluator may perform this activity as part of the activities associated with ensuring the AGD_OPE
		guidance satisfies the requirements.<h:p/>
		    
		For each required auditable event, the evaluator shall examine the operational guidance to determine
		that it is clear to the reader where each event is generated (e.g. the TSF may generate its own audit logs
		in one location while the platform-provided auditable events are generated elsewhere).
	</Guidance>
              <Tests>The evaluator shall test the TOE’s ability to correctly generate audit records by having the TOE generate
		audit records in accordance with the EAs associated with the functional requirements in the VPN Client 
		PP-Module. Additionally, the evaluator shall test that each administrative action applicable in the context
		of the VPN Client PP-Module is auditable. When verifying the test results, the evaluator shall ensure the
		audit records generated during testing match the format specified in the administrative guide, and that
		the fields in each audit record have the proper entries.
		<h:p/>

              Note that the testing here can be accomplished in conjunction with the testing of the security mechanisms
		directly. For example, testing performed to ensure that the administrative guidance provided is correct
		verifies that AGD_OPE.1 is satisfied and should address the invocation of the administrative actions that
		are needed to verify the audit records are generated as expected.

		define an iteration of FCS_COP.1 for symmetric

		Each of the supported Base-PPs except for the App PP define

		destruction functionality consistent with FCS_CKM.4, but with
		additional details that are specific to the respective

		Base-PP, this PP-Module defines its own instance of
		FCS_CKM_EXT.4 to achieve the same purpose. The
		dependency on FCS_CKM.4 is considered to be satisfied

		FAU_SEL.1/VPN has a dependency on FMT_MTD.1 to enforce

		is TSF data. This SFR is not explicitly defined in any of the
		supported Base-PPs but the dependency is implicitly
		addressed by each Base-PP in the following manner:<h:ul>
		<h:li>GPOS PP: The GPOS PP implicitly defines the
			existence of ‘user’ and ‘administrator’ roles in the
			extended SFRs FMT_MOF_EXT.1 and
			FMT_SMF_EXT.1. A TOE that conforms to this BasePP can associate the ability to perform the
			functionality defined by FAU_SEL.1/VPN to one or

		<h:li>App PP: The App PP does not define the existence of

		<h:td><h:b>FPT_STM.1 – Reliable Time Stamps</h:b></h:td>
	<h:td>
	  FAU_GEN.1/VPN has a dependency on FPT_STM.1 because
		audit records are required to have timestamps that are based
		on reliable clock data. All of the supported Base-PPs either
		define this requirement explicitly or provide rationale for why
		the reader to expect that a reliable clock service is expected
		to be present. Depending on the claimed Base-PP, the
		dependency is satisfied in the following manner:<h:ul>
		<h:li>GPOS PP: The GPOS PP states that FPT_STM.1 is
			implicitly satisfied by the requirements of FAU_GEN.1 
			since that requirement could not be satisfied if no
			clock service was present. Additionally, a clock
			service is reasonably assumed to be provided by a
			general-purpose OS.</h:li>
		<h:li>MDF PP: The MDF PP explicitly defines FPT_STM.1.</h:li>
		<h:li>App PP: The App PP assumption A.PLATFORM
			assumes that the general-purpose computing
			platform on which the TOE is installed is ‘a
			trustworthy computing platform.’ System time data is
			not explicitly mentioned but a clock service is
			reasonably assumed to be provided by a generalpurpose computer.</h:li>
		<h:li>MDM PP: The MDM PP assumption
			A.MDM_SERVER_PLATFORM assumes that the

	  FAU_GEN.1 has a dependency on FPT_STM.1. While not explicitly stated in the PP, it is assumed
	  that this will be provided by the underlying hardware platform on which the TOE is installed. 
	  This is because the TOE is installed as a software or firmware product that runs on general-purpose
