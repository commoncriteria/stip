    <sec:Overview>
      The scope of this PP-Module is to describe the security functionality of an SSL/TLS Inspection Proxy (STIP)
      in terms of  <xref g="CC"/> and to define functional and assurance requirements for such
      products. This PP-Module is intended for use with the following Base-PPs:

      <h:ul>
        <h:li>collaborative Protection Profile for Netowrk Devices (NDcPP), Version 2.2E</h:li>
      </h:ul>
      
      This Base-PP is valid because a STIP is a specific type of network appliance that is able to function as an authorized man-in-the-middle for TLS connections.
      <h:p/>
      This PP-Module is intended to specify the functionality of a network device that includes limited
      Certification Authority (CA) functionality to issue certificates for the purpose of providing network security
      services on the underlying plaintext. The device accomplishes this by terminating an intended TLS session
      between a monitored client and specified external servers. The device instead establishes a TLS session
      thread consisting of a TLS session between the device and the external server and a second TLS session
      between the device, acting as the external server, and the client. By replacing the end-to-end TLS session
      with two TLS sessions terminated at the TOE, the device is able to provide additional security services
      based on the decrypted plaintext.
      <h:p/>
      A network device meeting this PP-Module may perform additional security services on the plaintext,
      provide the decrypted payload to external network devices to perform the security services, or do both.
      These additional security services, whether processed internally or externally, may be performed inline,
      or passively. If multiple security services are provided, some may be inline, while others are performed
      passively. This PP-Module does not cover the specific requirements associated with various additional
      services.
      <h:p/>
      A TOE that conforms to a PP-Configuration containing this PP-Module may be a ‘Distributed TOE’ as
      defined in the NDcPP; however, the SSL/TLS Inspection Proxy functionality described in this PP-Module
      should be in a single TOE component. This PP-Module does not prohibit the TOE from implementing other
      security functionality in a distributed manner.

    <!-- 1.3 Compliant Targets of Evaluation -->
    <sec:Compliant_Targets_of_Evaluation>
      The Target of Evaluation (TOE) may be a single device or a collection of devices that interact with each
      other to meet the requirements of this PP-Module. Other network devices can be used to supplement
      inspection of plaintext traffic made available by the TOE. Such external devices will be considered as part
      of the operational environment, unless they are used to meet the requirements of this PP-Module. Audit,
      web, or directory servers providing access to certificate validity information generated by the TOE, and
      intermediate or root certification authorities that issue certificates to the TOE’s embedded certification
      authority are considered part of the operational environment and external to the TOE, but interfaces to
      these essential services which are required for operation of the TOE will be considered within the TOE
      boundary. Assurance activities to validate an interface include inspection and exercise of these interfaces
      using a specific instance of the service (audit server, web server, and external certification authority)
      implemented within the test environment.
      <h:p/>
      This PP-Module includes some functionality typical of firewalls. In particular, a device meeting this PP-Module is 
      configurable so that it can block or process TLS traffic between monitored clients and requested
      servers. It’s important to note that the device may support TLS connections for remote administration;
      these TLS connections are distinct from those between the monitored clients and requested servers, and
      must meet different requirements. In the case of an SSL/TLS inspection proxy, the primary processing is
      to inspect the TLS traffic. A TOE also has the capability of passing the TLS handshake messages intact to
      allow end-to-end TLS encrypted traffic between monitored clients and specific servers without providing
      additional services (bypass the inspection) on decrypted traffic. The decision to drop, process, or bypass
      traffic is based on IP addresses and ports, as well as on the content of TLS handshake messages, including
      the certificate of the server, and other characteristics of the traffic that might be available. A device can
      also determine which additional security services, especially those provided by external network devices,
      are applied to a particular session based on the plaintext exposed, such as HTTP headers including uniform
      resource locators (URLs), user passwords, or other sensitive information. 
      <h:p/>
      This PP-Module does not require facilitating inspection of mutually authenticated TLS sessions. It does not
      address the management of clients required to support inspection, nor requirements to avoid monitored
      clients from discovering the existence of such inspection. Processing to support Certificate Pinning is
      included as an optional requirement since establishing an inspection point prevents the monitored clients
      from doing so themselves. Similarly, management of the TOE’s certificate trust store is required, since
      monitored clients cannot block traffic from sites using certificates issued by compromised CA certificates
      after the traffic is inspected.
      
      <!-- 1.3.1 TOE Boundary -->
      <sec:TOE_Boundary>
        A STIP is one or more network devices that uses CA functionality to replace
        an end-to-end TLS session with a TLS session between the STIP and a monitored client and another TLS
        session between the STIP and the TLS endpoint requested by the monitored client (the requested server).
        Additional functionality within the same network component as STIP functionality, or via external network
        devices, can be used to perform network security services, such as performing intrusion detection or
        providing reputation services on the plaintext traffic made available by the TOE. This functionality, while
        enabled by the TOE is out of scope. However, protecting and separating traffic flows of plaintext to or
        between discrete functional components performing such network security services is required and
        considered within the TOE. If the TOE provides an external interface to plaintext traffic for additional
        network security services, the entirety of all external processing will be considered a single functional
        component – the TOE is not responsible for controlling the flow of traffic among external systems. 
        <h:p/>
        All functionality described by the SFRs are within the TOE boundary, as is the ability for the TSF to establish
        secure remote connections with trusted entities in the Operational Environment (OE).
        
        <figure entity="images/Toe.png" title="TLS Inspection Infrastructure" id="toe"/>
        
        <h:p/>
        As can be seen from this figure, the TOE sits between a monitored client and requested server in order to
        intercept TLS traffic between them. For connections subject to inspection, the TOE will replace the endto-end TLS session between the monitored client and requested server and establish a TLS session thread
        in order to forward the plaintext application traffic to one or more inspection processing functional
        components in the operational environment for inspection. The TSF provides an embedded CA that is
        used to reconstruct the TLS channel and pass it to its intended destination in an encrypted format. The
        embedded CA provides certificates it issues to an (external) certificate repository and provides certificate
        status information to an (internal or external) certificate status presentation mechanism.

    <!-- 1.4 Use Cases -->
    <!-- note: this section formatted a little different from its depiction in 1.0 because of schema constraints -->
    <sec:Use_Cases>
      Requirements in this PP-Module are designed to address the security problem in the following use cases.
      The description of these use cases provide instructions for how the TOE and its OE should be made to
      support the functionality required by this PP-Module.
      
      <h:p/>
      This PP-Module permits the inspection of mutually-authenticated TLS sessions between monitored clients
      and requested servers via exception processing. However, as a best practice, it is recommended instead
      that this behavior be handled as part of the TLS Inspection Bypass and/or TLS Session Blocking
      functionality. If the TOE provides inspection processing for mutually authenticated traffic, the ST must
      claim these optional SFRs.
      <h:p/>
      This PP-Module does not specify routing policies for non-TLS traffic and exception processing should not
      be used to address functionality otherwise included in the collaborative Protection Profile for Stateful
      Traffic Filter Firewalls.

  <!-- Security Problem Description -->
  <sec:Security_Problem_Description>
    The security problem is described in terms of the threats that the TOE is expected to address,
assumptions about its operational environment, and any organizational security policies that the TOE is
expected to enforce.<h:p/>
    A STIP is a network device that embeds limited CA functionality to support the
    replacement of end-to-end TLS sessions with TLS session threads, making the underlying plaintext
    available to additional network security functionality. As such, it exposes data within the TOE boundary,
    and to external processes, which would normally be encrypted. It manages a CA signing key that is trusted
    by the monitored clients to issue TLS server certificates representing the requested servers for which
    inspection is authorized.
    <h:p/>
    The proper installation and configuration of the VPN client is critical to its correct operation such that
    proper handling of the TOE by an administrator is also addressed.<h:p/>
    Note that as a PP-Module, all threats, assumptions, and OSPs defined in the Base-PP will also apply to a
    TOE unless otherwise specified, depending on which of the Base-PPs it extends. The Security Functional
    Requirements defined in this PP-Module will mitigate the threats that are defined in the PP-Module but
    may also mitigate some threats defined in the Base-PPs in more comprehensive detail due to the
    specific capabilities provided by a VPN client.

            Use of weak cryptography can allow adversary access to plaintext intended by the monitored clients

      <!-- Note: updated this section to be more in line with how these are done now. We don't want to use refinements on OE objectives because then multiple simultaneous PP-Module claims could cause mutually exclusive changes. -->
      The Operational Environment of the TOE implements technical and procedural measures to assist the
      TOE in correctly providing its security functionality (which is defined by the security objectives for the
      TOE). This section defines the security objectives that are to be addressed by the IT domain or by nontechnical or procedural means. As indicated above, if requirements supporting an objective on the TOE
      (in the previous table) are implemented in whole or in part by the platform, the ST should indicate this
      by an entry in this table with that objective.
      <h:p/>
      All security objectives for the operational environment of the Base-PP also apply to this PP-Module.
      <h:p/>
      OE.NO_THRU_TRAFFIC_PROTECTION is still operative, but only for the interfaces in the TOE that are defined by the Base-PP and not the PP-Module.
      <h:p/>
      OE.RESIDUAL_INFORMATION is still operative, but the residual information is expanded to include information relevant to STIP operation (e.g. decrypted SSL/TLS payload, ephemeral keys).

          <description>The operational environment includes an audit server with adequate storage to retain the audit

    The Security Functional Requirements (SFRs) included in this section are derived from Part 2 of the
    Common Criteria for Information Technology Security Evaluation, Version 3.1, Revision 5, with
    additional extended functional components.<h:p/>
    The CC defines operations on Security Functional Requirements: assignments, selections, assignments
    within selections and refinements. This document uses the following font conventions to identify the
    operations defined by the CC:<h:p/>
    <h:ul>
      <h:li>Assignments are indicated with <h:i>italicized</h:i> text.</h:li>
      <h:li>Refinements made by the PP-Module author are indicated with <h:b>bold text</h:b> for added or substituted
        text and <h:s>strikethrough</h:s> text for removed text. Refinements are only applied to significant technical
        changes to existing SFRs; minor presentation changes with no technical impact (such as British vs
        American spelling differences) are not marked as refinements. Refinements are also indicated when
        an operation is added or substituted for an existing operation (e.g. the PP-Module completes an
        assignment in such a way that it introduces a selection into the assignment).<h:p/>
        Note that for SFRs that are defined either in CC Part 2 or in this PP-Module’s Extended Components
        Definition, the refinement operation is used to indicate deviations from the defined component. For
        Base-PP SFRs that are modified by this PP-Module, the refinement operation is used to indicate
        deviations from the Base-PP’s definition of the SFR (i.e. if the Base-PP refined an SFR and that
        change is not affected by this PP-Module, it is not shown here as a refinement).</h:li>
      <h:li>Selections are indicated with <h:i>italicized</h:i> text.</h:li>
      <h:li>Iteration is indicated by appending the SFR name with a slash and unique identifier suggesting the
        purpose of the iteration, e.g. ‘/STIP’ for an SFR relating to STIP functionality.</h:li>
      <h:li>Extended SFRs are identified by having a label “EXT” after the SFR name.</h:li>
    </h:ul>
    Note that selections and assignments to be completed by the ST author are preceded with “selection:”
    and “assignment:”. If text is italicized and does not include either of these, it means that the selection or
    assignment has already been completed in this PP-Module and the ST author must use the text as
    written.

                device includes persistent keys, including the embedded CA’s signing private key
                that should not be destroyed until they are no longer needed. Security critical
                parameters includes security related information (e.g., secret and private
                cryptographic keys, authentication data such as passwords and PINs) appearing
                in plaintext or otherwise unprotected form and whose disclosure or modification
                can compromise the security of a CA or the security of the information protected
                by the CA or the security of the information protected by the CA.

                This SFR is refined in this PP-Module to include requirementsfor destruction of security critical parameters

            is only used for the Base-PP interfaces that may require certificates. 
            
            Right now we *have* to claim this SFR because it is selection-based when FTP_ITC.1 claims TLS, and it's currently refined to do so.
            
            Is the argument for having this be required that the TOE has to verify its own CA certificate when that is loaded onto the TOE so this SFR is what governs that behavior? That seems like the only non-STIP use of X.509 that the TOE 
            would actually be required to have. That would technically allow the SFR to be claimed which wouldn't break the FTP_ITC.1 dependency, but it is a little bit awkward because the dependency says "the TOE needs this because it supports TLS"
            but the reality in this Module is that the TOE's TLS capability has its own iteration of FIA_X509_EXT.1 for that, and FIA_X509_EXT.1/Rev is being claimed for "the TOE needs this because it supports having a certificate loaded onto it"
            which is obviously a different reason from the intended trigger. Is this something we could cover in the Implicitly Satisfied Requirements section?

          where a PP-Config may be defined one day where two Modules make different modifications to the same Base-PP SFR and so there's no clear guidance on how the ST author handles that. But if we do that here, we make it so that there is no reason

              “TLS” is moved outside the selection in the first element, since the TOE must
              implement TLS to accomplish the STIP functionality. The application notes for the
              first element from the Base-PP also apply.
              <h:p/>
              It is worth noting that since this SFR applies to all uses of certificates in the TOE, it
              may be the case that the actions taken in response to a failure to be able to
              determine revocation status (which is specified in the 2nd element) is handled
              differently for different connections. If this is the case, the ST author must make it
              clear which actions are associated with which connections so that the correct
              evaluation of the functionality can be performed.
              <h:p/>
              The second element has three modifications from that in the Base-PP. First, the
              word “validity” is replaced with “revocation status” for clarity. This is consistent
              with what is in the application note in the NDcPP, and using “revocation status”
              more directly indicates what is required.
              <h:p/>
              Second, the general notion of “administrator” is replaced with the more refined
              roles defined in this PP-Module; the ST author should make the appropriate
              selection.
              <h:p/>
              Finally, a selection is added that allows ST author flexibility in addressing the issue
              of failure to connect to check revocation status in the specific case that the
              certificates being checked are associated with either a monitored client or a
              requested server. This selection (“to associate the failed connection event per
              FDP_TEP_EXT.1.5”), when chosen, indicates that selected administrative role is
              able to specify a STIP operation (block, bypass, inspect) to be taken in the event
              that the revocation status can’t be checked. The requirement that the TOE be able
              to perform this operation when such an event occurs is specified in
              FDP_TEP_EXT.1.5.

                in an connection that uses mutual authentication). A STIP TOE must present an X.509 certificate to an external entity as part of TLS session proxying. The TOE may obtain this certificate either using PKCS#10 (covered by this SFR) or
                through Enrollment over Secure Transport (EST), which is covered by the selection-based SFR FIA_ESTC_EXT.1. Therefore, the ST author only claims FIA_X509_EXT.3 if PKCS#10 is selected in FIA_ENR_EXT.1.

	  <!-- 6.1.4 Consistency of Requirements -->
	  <!-- This PP-Module identifies several SFRs from the GPOS PP that are needed to support VPN client
		functionality. This is considered to be consistent because the functionality provided by the operating
		system is being used for its intended purpose. The PP-Module also identifies a number of modified SFRs
		from the GPOS PP as well as new SFRs that are used entirely to provide VPN client functionality. The
		rationale for why this does not conflict with SFRs defined by the GPOS PP are as follows: -->
	  
      <con-mod ref="fcs-ckm-1-vpn">Generation of IKE peer authentication keys is added functionality that does
		not prevent the existing GPOS functions from being performed.</con-mod>
      <con-mod ref="fcs-ipsec-ext-1">This SFR defines the VPN client’s IPsec implementation, which is added
		functionality that does not interfere with the GPOS functions.</con-mod>
      <con-mod ref="fdp-rip-2">The requirement to protect against re-use of residual data is a property of
		the VPN client behavior and does not impact the GPOS functionality.</con-mod>
      <con-mod ref="fmt-smf-1-vpn">The ability to configure the VPN client behavior does not affect whether the
		GPOS as a whole can perform its security functions.</con-mod>
      <con-mod ref="fpt-tst-ext-1-vpn">Self-testing of the VPN client functionality does not impact the ability of the
		GPOS to perform its security functions.</con-mod>

      <con-mod ref="fau-gen-1-vpn">Audit records generated by the VPN client do not interfere with GPOS
		functionality. The possibility of the underlying OS platform generating audit
		records is consistent with the GPOS PP, which already contains FAU_GEN.1.</con-mod>
      <con-mod ref="fau-sel-1-vpn">The ability to suppress the generation of certain audit records related to
		VPN activity does not interfere with the ability of the GPOS to satisfy its
		security functionality.</con-mod>
      <con-mod ref="fdp-ifc-ext-1-vpn">The ability of the VPN client to prevent split tunneling of IPsec traffic
		requires it to have hooks into lower-level OS behavior, but there are no
		requirements in the GPOS PP that would prevent this functionality from
		being supported.</con-mod>

              This requirement applies to the TOE regardless of whether the audit trail is stored
              within the TOE boundary or on an external system in the Operational
              Environment. If the audit trail is stored locally, then the requirement applies when
              the audit trail cannot be written to when it is full. If the audit trail (in whole or in
              part) is stored on a system external to the TOE, then the requirement applies when
              the connection between the TOE and the external audit server becomes 
              disconnected and the audit trail cannot be written to. In the case where the audit
              trail is external to the TOE and cannot be written to because it is full (and the TOE
              has some way of detecting that), then the requirement applies in that case as well.
              In all cases, the ST author is expected to describe (in the TSS) how the TSF is made
              aware of any such failures and how it behaves in response.

              may be required by the monitored clients; additional cipher suites can be included

              the ST; FCS_TTTC_EXT.1.4 indicates that the cipher suites are presented in order
              of preference in the Client Hello sent to the requested server, and that preference

              The above list (as instantiated in the ST) limits the cipher suites that may be

              not contain an identifier of type IP address, and no other name type is included as
              a reference Identifier, the IP address from the underlying transport layer protocol

              this transaction may be made even though the result will eventually be block or

          Support for through-traffic processing defined in this module requires that the TSF support the TLS server
protocol using an implementation that provides functionality expected for the set of monitored clients
being protected by the TOE. In general, the functionality may not be appropriate to support
communications with the TOE for other SFR in the Base-PP. This SFR describes the TLS connection
established to support STIP functionality between the monitored client and the TOE, such that the TOE is
operating as the TLS client. Because it may be necessary to support “legacy” TLS versions and cipher suites
for mission reasons, the SFR requires support for current and legacy TLS versions as well as current and
legacy cipher suites. -->

              internet layer and transport layer protocols that are used to determine the
              indicated fields that can be applicable when constructing rules for this policy.

              The TLS Client Hello messages, and optional client certificate messages are
              received on the client side interface only. If the TSF supports client authentication,
              ‘TLS client certificate message’ should be selected (with the appropriate subselections supported by the TOE), and FCS_TTTS_EXT.3,
              Authentication of Monitored Clients should be claimed.
              <h:p/>
              The TLS certificate message is received on a server side interface prior to the TSF
              sending a Server Hello done message on the client side interface. </note>

              The first selection is chosen if the TOE supports rules based on both a monitored

              The first item is chosen if the TOE supports multiple responses to a client certificate request message from a requested server; FDP_TEP_EXT.1.7 and its Application Note have additional details.
              <h:p/>
              The second item is chosen if FIA_X509_EXT.2 indicates a privileged user may

              The third item is chosen if the TOE supports detection of a critical extension in a

              interpret. RFC 5280 indicates that this situation results in an invalid certificate, but
              FIA_X509_EXT.1/STIP provides an additional option that—instead of treating the
              certificate as invalid (and thus blocking the connection)—the administrator can
              indicate that the “Bypass” operation is to be applied to the connection instead
              (which essentially defers the decision to make the connection to the client). See

            <note role="application">
              The ST author will select one or more response options according to the capabilities of the TSF. 
              A mutual authentication inspection operation is a variant of the inspection operation. 
              If this item is selected, the mutual authentication SFRs FCS_TTTC_EXT.3 and FCS_TTTS_EXT.3 must be claimed. 
              If mutual authentication is not supported, one or more of the remaining options is selected: 'Block' and 
              'send an empty certificate list as part of the inspection operation' are alternative methods to ensure that 
              certificates issued by the TOE's embedded certificate authority are not provided to requested servers that are not known to trust the CA. 
              Block is initiated by the TSF; the TOE terminates the TLS session, whereas 'send an empty certificate list...' 
              allows the requested server to continue with the TLS session without client authentication or terminate the session.
              <h:p/>
              Inspection of mutual authenticated TLS requires both the client and server to trust the embedded CA, 
              and therefore has limited use. 
              It is preferred that inspection of mutual authenticated TLS be performed by components of the requested server security architecture 
              (e.g. via a traffic filtering firewall or an attribute-based access control mechanism) 
              and not be performed by devices described in this PP-Module. 
              If mutual authentication inspection is selected, 
              then the selection-based requirements FCS_TTTC_EXT.3 and FCS_TTTS_EXT.3 will be included by the ST author, 
              and the “mutual authentication” item will be selected in FCS_TTTC_EXT.1.1 and FCS_TTTS_EXT.1.1.
              <h:p/>
              If more than one response option is selected, the ‘mutual authentication block-bypass’ exception specification must be claimed in FDP_TEP_EXT.1.5 
              and be configurable within the TLS session establishment policy to determine which of the supported operations will be applied for a specific requested server. 
              It is expected, but not required, that one of the selected operations will be a default operation and the other determined by the server matching the exception specification.

                configure the TLS session establishment policy to meet the requirements in this component are provided.
              </Guidance>
              <Tests>
                <h:b>Setup:</h:b> The evaluator shall configure one or more monitored clients to present TLS requests to various TLS
                servers through the TOE. The TLS servers will obtain certificates issued by an external certification
                authority trusted by the TSF. The client, server, and the server certificates will meet the conditions
                described in each test. The evaluator shall configure the TOE according to operational guidance to have
                non-trivial rules for all TLS session establishment policy states. The evaluator shall conduct the following
                tests, establishing any additional configuration requirements as indicated in each.
                <testlist>
                  <test>For each rule of the TLS establishment policy indicating inspection operation processing, the
                    evaluator shall ensure the monitored client is configured to meet the requirements for FCS_TLSC_EXT.1,
                    the requested server is configured to meet the requirements for FCS_TLSS_EXT.1, and the server
                    certificate is valid according to FIA_X509_EXT.1/STIP. The evaluator shall configure the TSF so the rule
                    applies to the monitored client and requested server. The evaluator shall establish a TLS session from the
                    monitored client to the requested server through the TOE. The evaluator shall then observe the TSF audit
                    record, certificate repository, TLS Server Hello data received at the client, plaintext encrypted at the client,
                    and plaintext decrypted by the requested server. The evaluator shall then confirm that the TSF established
                    a TLS session with the requested server, issued a certificate representing the requested server, established
                    a TLS session with the monitored client, decrypted the data, performed any inspection processing, and
                    presented the data to the requested server via the established TLS session.</test>
                  <test>For each rule of the TLS establishment policy indicating bypass processing, the evaluator shall
                    establish a monitored client, requested server, and server certificate that meets the rule. The evaluator
                    shall send a TLS request from the monitored client to the requested server through the TOE, and then
                    inspect logs, certificate repository, certificate received by the monitored client in the Server Hello
                    message, plaintext encrypted by the monitored client, and plaintext decrypted by the requested server to
                    confirm that bypass processing occurred.</test>
                  <test>The evaluator shall follow AGD guidance to ensure the TSF is configured to log blocked TLS sessions.
                    For each rule of the TLS establishment policy indicating blocking of the TLS session, as indicated in any
                    element of this component, the evaluator shall establish that a monitored client, a requested server, and
                    a server certificate meet the rule. The evaluator shall send a TLS session from the monitored client to the
                    requested server through the TOE and observe that the monitored client receives an error response in
                    accordance with FDP_STIP_EXT.1.5 indicating that the session was blocked. The evaluator shall inspect
                    the TSF logs to verify that each session was recorded as blocked.</test>
                  <test>For each event that initiates a transition from the inspection operation to the block operation, the
                    evaluator shall attempt to establish a monitored client and requested server, and configure the TOE and
                    its TLS session establishment policy to invoke the event. For each such event, the evaluator shall initiate
                    a TLS session from the monitored client to the requested server through the TOE. The evaluator shall
                    monitor traffic between the monitored client and the TOE, and monitor traffic between the TOE and the
                    requested client, observing that TLS handshake messages prior to the event are sent, and that any TLS
                    sessions established prior to the event are terminated on transition of the session to the block operation.
                    The evaluator shall observe that the monitored client receives the specified error message indicating that
                    the TLS session is blocked.
                  </test>
                  <test>
                    <!-- Note: changed conditional statement to make it more obvious what the trigger is for this test --> 
                    Test 5 [conditional, both 'mutual authentication inspection' and 'send an empty certificate list as part of the inspection operation' are selected in FDP_TEP_EXT.1.7]:
                    The evaluator shall establish a server to send certificate requests in its TLS handshake. 
                    The evaluator shall extablish a monitored client configured to provide a valid client certificate in response to a certificate request. 
                    The evaluator shall follow AGD guidance to configure the TLS inspection proxy policy to send an empty certificate list in a certificate message to the server, 
                    and initiate a TLS request from a monitored client to the server through the TOE. 
                    The evaluator shall observe network traffic between the TOE and the requested server and confirm that the TOE sends an empty certificate list to the server after receiving the certificate request.
                    <h:p/>
                    Using the same server, the evaluator shall follow AGD guidance to configure the TSF to perform mutual authentication inspection with the server, 
                    and initiate a TLS request from the same monitored client ro the same requested server through the TOE. 
                    The evaluator shall observe network traffic between the TOE and the requested server and confirm the TOE sends a certificate message containing a client certificate representing the monitored client.

              FIA_X509_EXT.1.1/STIP lists the rules for validating certificates for STIP
              Functions. The text that says what to do if revocation information is not

              The ST author selects whether revocation status is verified using OCSP or CRLs.
              The SFR indicates that the TOE be capable of supporting a minimum path length
              of three certificates. This means that the TOE supports a hierarchy comprising
              of at least a self-signed root CA certificate, a subordinate CA certificate, and a
              leaf certificate. The chain validation is expected to terminate with a trust
              anchor. This means the validation can terminate with any trusted CA certificate
              designated as a trust anchor. This CA certificate must be loaded into the trust
              store ('certificate store', ' trusted CA Key Store' or similar) managed by the TOE
              trust store. If the TOE’s trust store supports loading of multiple hierarchical CA
              certificates or certificate chains, the TOE must clearly indicate all certificates
              that it considers trust anchors. The validation of X.509v3 leaf certificates
              comprises several steps: <h:ol type="a">
                <h:li>A Certificate Revocation Check refers to the process of determining the
                  current revocation status of an otherwise structurally valid certificate.
                  This must be performed every time a certificate is used for
                  authentication. This check must be performed for each certificate in the
                  chain up to, but not including, the trust anchor. This means that CA
                  certificates that are not trust anchors, and leaf certificates in the chain,
                  must be checked. It is not required to check the revocation status of any
                  CA certificate designated a trust anchor, however if such check is
                  performed it must be handled consistently with how other certificates
                  are checked.</h:li>
                <h:li>An expiration check must be performed. This check must be conducted
                  for each certificate in the chain, up to and including the trust anchor.</h:li>
                <h:li>The continuity of the chain must be checked, showing that the signature
                  on each certificate that is presented to the TOE is valid and the chain
                  terminates at the trust anchor.</h:li>
                <h:li>The presence of relevant extensions in each certificate in the chain such
                  as the extendedKeyUsage parameters of the leaf certificate must
                  correspond to SFR-relevant functionality. For example, a peer acting as
                  a web server should have TLS Web Server Authentication listed as an
                  extendedKeyUsage parameter of its X.509v3 certificate. The TOE
                  ensuresthat the relevant extensions in each certificate in the chain such
                  as the extendedKeyUsage parameters of the leaf certificate correspond
                  to the SFR-relevant functionality they are used with.</h:li>
              </h:ol><h:p/>
              It is expected that revocation checking is performed when a certificate is used
              in an authentication step. It is expected that revocation checking is performed
              on both leaf and intermediate CA certificates when a leaf certificate is presented
              to the TOE as part of the certificate chain during authentication. Revocation
              checking of any CA certificate designated a trust anchor is not required.
              <h:p/>
              If the TOE implements mutual authentication or acts as a server, there is no
              expectation of performing any checks on TOE’s own leaf certificate during
              authentication. FIA_X509_EXT.1.2/STIP applies to certificates that are used and
              processed by the TSF and restricts the certificates that may be added as trusted
              CA certificates.

            The management functions defined in this table are the same as the management
            functions defined in FMT_SMF.1 in the Base-PP as well as those defined in FMT_SMF.1/STIP in this PP-Module. The NDcPP only requires management
            functionality to be performed by a Security Administrator. This PP-Module defines optional additional management roles that may be claimed; if any of these are selected,
            this PP-Module provides guidance on how to apply those roles to the Base-PP's management functions.
            <h:p/>
            The Management Functions and Privileges table uses the following key:
            M: Mandatory (this role must perform this function)
            <h:p/>
            CM: Conditionally Mandatory (if this role is part of the TSF it must perform this
            function but if the role itself does not exist it may be satisfied elsewhere)
            <h:p/>
            C: Conditional (if a role does not exist to satisfy a conditionally mandatory
            function, this is that function’s “backup” role)
            <h:p/>
            O: Optional (this role may or may not perform this function)
            <h:p/>
            The ST author should reproduce this table and update as needed to show which
            functions are implemented by which roles.
            <h:p/>
            If a selectable function has a mandatory role mapping, this means that if the
            function is implemented it must be satisfied in a certain way; it does not mean
            that it is mandatory to implement that function.
            <h:p/>
            If a selectable function does not have a mandatory role but is mapped to multiple
            optional roles, then at least one of them must be selected if the function is
            implemented.

<!--	<section title="TOE Security Assurance Requirements" id="s-sar">  -->
		  As a PP-Module of the NDcPP, this PP-Module does not define any additional assurance requirements
		  above and beyond what is defined in the Base-PP. In general, application of the SARs to the TOE boundary
		  described by both the NDcPP and this PP-Module is sufficient to demonstrate that the claimed SFRs have
		  been implemented correctly by the TOE. However, in some cases it may be necessary to perform
		  additional assurance activities in order to satisfy the SARs due to unique capabilities or limitations of the
		  TOE that is specified by this PP-Module. Where applicable, these evaluation activities are described below.
			
			
			<!-- Note: what is the syntax for describing specific SARs and defining EAs for them? <subsection> tag used to work in e.g. MDF but does not seem to be working with the current transforms. And since that isn't working, <aactivity> underneath it

		    traffic between monitored clients and requested servers should be paid. Additionally, vulnerabilities
		    related to the embedded CA functionality within this technology have significant consequences for both
		    the TOE and the monitored clients the TOE is intended to protect and should be thoroughly researched.</subsection> -->
		  
		  <!-- Note: This is formatted differently from how the SD did it because there is no clean way to format what the SD did. -->

		    <h:ul>
		      <h:li>For Type 1 (Public Vulnerability-Based) Hypotheses, the evaluator shall also consider search phrases consisting of "TLS" 
		        n conjunction with each of the supported
		        specific cipher suite components (e.g. “TLS TDES,” “TLS CBC,” “TLS_SHA1”…) and with each supported
		        version (e.g. “TLS 1.0,” “TLS 1.2,”…) be added as search criteria. Search criteria shall also include all names
		        used to represent this technology (e.g., “SSL inspection,” “TLS inspection proxy,” “middle box,” “Deep
		        inspection Firewall,”…).</h:li>

		      <!-- Note: Modified the change to Type 2 to make it more clear, is this ok? -->
      <!-- 
		      <h:li>For Type 2 (iTC-Source) Hypotheses, it is noted that any flaws that are specific to this PP-Module will be submitted to the NIAP TC for SSL/TLS Inspection Proxy, 
		      and that any flaws that are considered general to the technology type will be added to those that should be considered via NIAP Technical Decisions.</h:li>
		      <h:li>The evaluator shall consider the following additional flaw hypotheses based on the TOE's inclusion of deprecated TLS versions and cipher suites that use obsolete algorithms:
		      <h:ul>
		        <h:li>Bleichenbacher type side-channel based padding Oracle flaw (CVE-2018-16868 and equivalent): this flaw is typically mitigated by randomizing computations associated with key material.</h:li>
		        <h:li>Bleichenbacher RSA padding Oracle flaw (CVE-2017-17428 and equivalent): this flaw is typically mitigated by ensuring consistency of error alerts for various events
		          related to decrypting the master key.</h:li>
		        <h:li>TLS Padding Oracle Vulnerability (CVE-2019-6485 and equivalent): this flaw is typically mitigated by randomizing the IV via insertion of empty fragments into
		          application data.</h:li>
		        <h:li>SHA-1 collision flaws (CVE-2005-4900 and equivalent): for this technology, a mitigation may include limiting the validity of issued certificates to

	<!-- Appendix A: Optional Requirements -->
 	    <!--
	    As indicated in the introduction to this PP-Module, the baseline requirements (those that must be
		performed by the TOE) are contained in the body of this PP-Module. This Appendix contains three other
		types of optional requirements that may be included in the ST but are not required in order to conform
		to this PP-Module.
		The first type (in A.1) are strictly optional requirements that are independent of the TOE implementing
		any function. If the TOE fulfills any of these requirements or supports a certain functionality, the vendor
		is encouraged but not required to add the related SFRs.
		The second type (in A.2) are objective requirements that describe security functionality not yet widely
		available in commercial technology. The requirements are not currently mandated in the body of this
		PP-Module, but will be included in the baseline requirements in future versions of this PP-Module.
		Adoption by vendors is encouraged and expected as soon as possible.
		The third type (in A.3) are implementation-dependent requirements that are dependent on the TOE
		implementing a particular function. If the TOE fulfills any of these requirements, the vendor must either
		add the related SFR or disable the functionality for the evaluated configuration.

      <section title="Authentication of Monitored Clients" id="s-b4">
        This section describes support for mutual authentication of clients when requested by the TOE to support
        the following use cases: <h:ul>
        <h:li>TOE requested mutual authentication: Mutual authentication provides authenticated client
        attributes that can be used to define exception processing. If the ST claims to support client
        authentication of monitored clients accessing the TOE, this SFR should be claimed in the
        selection of FDP_STIP_EXT.1.</h:li>
        <h:li>Certificate request from the requested server: Inspection of TLS sessions requiring mutual
        authentication is a narrow use case for the SSL/TLS inspection proxy, where both the client
        and server trust the TOE’s embedded CA. In such instances, mutual authentication represents
        an assertion to the requested server that the client has been authenticated. There are other,
        preferred mechanisms such as SOAP, KERBEROS, XAML assertions, than TLS client
        authentication using proxy certificates that provide a more accurate representation of the
        role of a federated identity service provider, in accordance with NIST SP 800-63-03. Also,
        mutual authentication is typically used to control access to sensitive information authorized
        only to specific clients, and the willingness of the server’s content owner to trust the proxy,
        providing access such sensitive content further restricts legitimate use cases. Finally,
        certificates issued to represent users subject to a certificate policy or certificate practice
        statement, especially those compliant with NIST FIPS 201, may be required to meet an
        equivalent certificate policy or certificate practice statement.</h:li>
        </h:ul>
        If mutual authentication by the TOE is to perform the TLS inspection operation on TLS sessions between
        monitored clients and requested servers requiring mutual authentication, FCS_TTTC_EXT.3,
        FCS_TTTS_EXT.3, FDP_CER_EXT.4, FDP_CER_EXT.5, FDP_CSI_EXT.2, and FDP_STIP_EXT.2 in this section
        must be claimed. In addition, the ‘mutual authentication inspection’ item should be selected in the
        selection for FDP_TEP_EXT.1.5 and an exception specification to identify servers which are authorized and
        configured to support mutual authentication inspection must be described in the assignment of
        FDP_TEP_EXT.1.4. TLS servers requesting mutual authentication are likely to also require revocation
        information, so it is recommended that FDP_CSIR_EXT.1 selections be made to provide certificate status
        information, even if the constraint for short validity periods is achieved
